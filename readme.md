# WordPress Plugin Generator

## WIP

WordPress Plugin Generator allows you to generate the structure of a basic WordPress plugin quickly and easily.
For Shortlist Studio users only, it will create a repository on our team account.

## Setup

* Clone the repo in to your projects folder
* `cd`in to repo
* `composer install`
* `cd` in to the directory you'd like to place your new plugin 
    * e.g. `cd [projects-folder]/[project-name]/web/app/dev/` 
* Run generator `php /[projects-folder]/index.php`
    * Set the plugin name e.g. Agreable Time Machine Plugin
    * Set the description e.g. This Croissant compatible plugin can make you travel through time
    * Set your github username e.g. saltymargaret
